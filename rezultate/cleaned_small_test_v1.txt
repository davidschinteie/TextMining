i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine ill admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge
actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 us open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his bristish idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played im no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbos carnivale and rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the us open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes i loved the rain soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings theres some compelling character development when the british harry vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century you know how this is going to end not only because its based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience
as a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sports history i was pleased with disneys sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry vardon fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young ouimet goes through his own class struggles being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing  what i loved best however is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of ouimets parents his father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class his mother however recognizes her sons talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior finally the golf scenes are well photographed although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film theres one little disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think disney the ending as in miracle is not some disney creation but one that only human history could have written
i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it wont be because it doesnt deserve to before this film i didnt realize how charming shia lebouf could be he does a marvelous self contained job as the lead theres something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out  this is one id recommend to anyone
bill paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds the acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end   the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie
i saw this film on september 1st 2005 in indianapolis i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life heartland gave that award to this film this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs with this backdrop this based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world harry vardon and the story is inspirational against all odds francis ouimet played by shia labeouf of holes gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the us and great britain at the 1913 us open francis is ill prepared and has a child for a caddy the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in but despite these handicaps francis displays courage spirit heroism and humility at this world class event and we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden clubs the layout of the short holes the manual scoreboard the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the titans fyi   there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years
maybe im reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing documenting etc and that would make it a little biased buthis family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongshengs life i think the best view would have been told from hongshengs family and friends perspectives they saw his transformation and werent so messed up on drugs that they remember everything as for hongsheng being full of himself the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life metaphorically of course hes obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his familys happiness huh the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms his head cocked to the side its fabulous that hes off of drugs now but hes no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle this same device is used in ted demmes blow where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero however quitting zuotian is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if hongshengs life was merely a play told in many difficult parts
i felt this film did have many good qualities the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly of course they are playing themselves but definitely unique the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use i found the jia hongsheng story interesting on a down note the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001 so its really cheesy sometimes the beatles crap etc whatever not a top ten or twenty but if its on the television check it out
this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job its like theyre almost living the past over again jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most theres moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job however this movie is not for everyone many people who suffer from depression will understand hongshengs problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself others might see the movie as boring because its just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad
quitting may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal as a rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim but what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clichés no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims  hongshen jia is in his mid twenties hes a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon hes the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf his acting means the arts friends  and roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his self criticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred   i didnt know how to act i felt like a phony  and to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity  hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittent  and doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors   not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and high rises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to ritan park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific he drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancers positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night  central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist   but hes the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as johns son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park  hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennons influence as showing me a new way in the mental institute the life saving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennons presence as does hongshens need to re hang his heros poster in his redecorated room if lennons influence is spiriting hongshens fathers influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that hes chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions its this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to hongshens emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why cant a peasant be your father  under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity banishes his black cloud all his edges soften you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy hongshen says of this movie its a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity
i loved this movie from beginning to endi am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to loveskateboardingdrawing but my friends were always there for memusic was like my rehablife supportand my drugit changed my lifei can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could saythis movie left me speechless to be honesti just saw it on the ifc channeli usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellitethe ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movieim not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the dont do a very good job on translating linesi mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guessi almost never got to see this amazing moviegood thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bedwell earlier than usualloli hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i didi wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the filmi give it three thumbs way up this movie blew me away
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character *******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance ****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna millers performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
i first saw this movie on ifc which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesnt hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just cant hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels  the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or disliking a loophole in the plot there are no loopholes in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if youre new to foreign films this is a great start
i must say every time i see this movie i am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of hongshengs life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction it is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family since family is the #1 priority in the asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him her this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the genuineness of the movie
my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him  ***spoiler*** plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health profession
i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002 this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors jia hongshengs parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well the film has a heavy feel but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation
night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte lahaiein factmany of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filmingthis film is certainly different than rollins usual lesbian vampire flicksbut its not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascinationlahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who cant remember who she is or where she came frommost of the film takes place in a modern apartment complexwhere lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group thats treating a number of people with a similar conditionanywayshe escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are heldon a highway outside of townshe meets a young manwho stops and picks her upnight of the hunted offers plenty of nudityunfortunately the pace is extremely slowthe atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well developedstill night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyablegive it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollins works7 out of 10 and thats being kind
even if youre a fan of jean rollins idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight  true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jean claude coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe bréjean a k a gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cash gathering xxx efforts most notably french f*ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gardère driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the 70s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding when robert leaves for work hes inevitably erased from elisabeths feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes re introduced to her roommate catherine the late cathérine greiner a k a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup its also catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them several rather explicit   if not quite hardcore   sex scenes make up the movies mid section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey a k a cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the films rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of véronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet   in her unforgettable debut   who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirellis la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplins modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands
i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte lahaie there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldnt bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who cant remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of its time 8 out of 10 kids
i have certainly not seen all of jean rollins films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except its in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along its obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesnt prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris & his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find whats going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to whats going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out 8 out of 10
since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its contemporaries its a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well thats because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funny felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he cant sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop hell get every shoe sold felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes  rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store in gratitude the guy gives felix $500 however felixs owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak along once there felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurray
despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isnt too sticky and pink because love is as a rose with thorns that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth  the music and lyrics of the cabaret chanson esquire songs sung b keira knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it ís mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy  london gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger  maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story
felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywoods most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast
a gem of a cartoon from the silent era   it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameosdouglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as boss of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felixs near bankrupt shoe =salesman boss cannot be described  it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem
this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplins work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended
felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich the dramatic guy that tells felix hell have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies hes in tears felix just looks at him like hes nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and thats how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there we then witness felixs attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this 95  minute cartoon its amazing how much more you can get in an extra 25 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff
while i cant say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters   and a more insane cobra commander we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other *officers* around instead the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi its overall pretty good if not a little over the top
errol flynns roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous and some would say infamous general custer that follows his career from his first day at west point through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland some might say that flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing custer a lavish production that should have been in technicolor well directed by raoul walsh they died with their boots on features some truly well staged battle sequences also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse the previous year flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagans george custer in santa fe trail also with de havilland another action packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class
warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in big trail director raoul walshs first rate western they died with their boots on a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol flynns signature roles and one of raoul walshs greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynns romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this 140 minute black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war indeed sheridan was a lieutenant at this point in fact the commandant was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented custer as a drinker probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high ranking foreign general the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp arthur kennedy of city for conquest to take charge of him sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe stanley ridges of task force who promptly runs custer out naturally the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl general phil sheridan john litel of the sons of katie elder is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming as it turns out sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled once he enrolls custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore when the american civil war erupts west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer avid as he is to get into the fight custer encounters his future wife elizabeth libby bacon olivia de havilland of santa fe trail and they pledge themselves to each other despite mr bacon gene lockhart of carousel who detests the sight of custer it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custers friends and our hero reprimanded bacon meanwhile back in washington custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment but major taipe has him cooling his heels custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custers characteristics not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry but also custer appropriates taipes horse to get to his command during the battle of bull run 21 july 1861 custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital custer receives a medal rather than a court martial when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg in pennsylvania scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph when a brigadier general cannot be found scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer a mistake is made and custer is promoted incredulous at first custer embraces the moment and cracks stuarts advance after the war custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds eventually libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan who was in command of the army and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th cavalry when he takes command custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort meanwhile custer has his first run in with crazy horse anthony quinn of the guns of navarone and takes him into custody of course crazy horse escapes becomes custers adversary and they fight once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl on his way to washington custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the little big horn in a slam bang showdown against 6000 redskins stagecoach lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory the long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular as an added premonition of custers imminent demise libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn they died with their boots on benefits from a top notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune gary owen
if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know thats hard to do when you consider custers last stand at the little big horn and its prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it theres a lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time custers arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custers first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadnt noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too as for flynn its interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed jeb stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here its more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligans take on the military hero in 1970s little big man lets just say that one was a bit over the top the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custers character when he stated   you take glory with you when its your time to go
after working on 7 movies with director mickael curtiz the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography the died with their boots on is their first and best film together raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer errol flynn from his debuts at west point to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn its true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer but thats not important what is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters who can forget california joe the great queens own buttler with his song garryowen the touching mrs custer olivia de havilland the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy  an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso
i first viewed they died with there boots onabout 1970 and though it has been many years sincethis film and its impression remainthe cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroicwhen i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then somei felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custerhowever the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind setthis is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyableyet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as wellcuster ranked 34 in a graduating class of34much has been made of custers final class rankingbut of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation dayjune 241861it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accidenthis squadron would follow him to hellyour at attention sargeantreprimands tapeif iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attaché to not only sheridanbut hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellanthere is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederatesas a lone union soldier surrounded by rebelscusters audacity shone throughhe accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiersincluding a rebel captainyet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomacthis notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promiserobert lbateman armchair generalthere is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custerthe story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposesthough this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as wellthey were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military careerthe list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officerhe was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the meansand the informationdiscovered wrapped around some cigars was general lees plans to split his forcesand yet he failed to act for some 17 hoursit can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburgpahis forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6000 rebels with but a force of 2300i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussionthere is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regimentsthough custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believethe truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flankthis action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of successit was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and besthis men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character *******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance ****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna millers performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
i blame birth of a nation myself   for commencing the long running tradition of hollywood travesties of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wifes learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custers testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custers storming into the presidents office to beg to return to his post honestly theres plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet its still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think were closer to the legend of the legend but hey its only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that
being warner brothers second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn general george armstrong custer they died with their boots on warner brothers 1941 was the far more accurate of the two especially when contrasted with santa fe trail warner brothers 1940 which really didnt set the bar very high although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn there was a change in the casting the part of general custer whereas it was dutch himself ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture with mr flynn playing virginian and later confederate hero general jeb or jeb stuart errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on once again the warner brothers propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the warners repertory company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity and all is really happening right before our very own eyes major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses such as elizabeth bacon mrs custer co star olivia de havilland ned sharpe arthur kennedy samuel bacon gene lockhart chief crazy horse anthony quinn californy charlie grapwin major taipe stanley ridges general phillip sheridan john litel callie the bacons maid hattie mcdaniel  the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited though skilled players such as joe sawyer eleanor parker minor watson tod andrews irving bacon roy barcroft lane chandler spencer charters frank ferguson francis ford william forrest george eldridge russell hicks william hopper hoppity hooper eddie keane fred kelsey sam mcdaniel patrick mcvey frank orth eddie parker addison richards ray teal jim thorpe all american himself minerva urecal dick wessel gig young and many many more the film moves very quickly particularly in the early goings then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years the assignment of custer as a colonel in the 7th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn in montana under the guidance of director griffith veteran raoul walsh the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions from the very serious exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos as with most any of mr walshs films he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy farce actually as previously mentioned this is much more factual than its predecessor santa fe trail last time well mention it honest schultz scouts honor however that is not to say that it wasnt without a few little bits of artistic and literary license as indeed just about any biopic will have it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that business about custers being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general it just didnt happen that way yet the gag both helped the film to move along while it underscored the whole light carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film director walsh and mr flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident being the massacre by the lakota sioux the cheyenne and the fukowi of custer and his 7th cavalry at the little big horn at the time of its occurrence june 25 1876 custers last stand was as big an incident and shock to the americans national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor december 7 1941 or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new yorks twin trade towers and the united states armed forces headquarters in the pentagon arlington virginia on september 11 2002 just as so many films of that period of world war ii and the years immediately before there were so many incidents in it that were if not intentionally done were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period poodle schnitz
when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland they died with their boots on 1941 is most likely the film remembered best it is the sweeping saga of general custer flynn   told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon dehavilland through his tenure during the american civil war and finally with his death at little big horn director raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion hence the battle against chief crazy horse anthony quinn is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians   california joe charley grapewin and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nations first peoples  flynn who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer has never been more ignoble he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine resident warner stock players arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them overall then despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday matinée or sunday night cooing with ones sweetheart warners dvd is pretty nice looking although film grain is often obvious the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep solid blacks and very clean whites some fading is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level
the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more villainous anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight however i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywoods golden age
its true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custers errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a favorable light im almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anti custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison further one should not be mislead by the title of the picture  this isnt just a movie about the battle of the little big horn its a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husband the movie begins with custers time at the west point military academy where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits during a punitive military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland who like custer himself is a native of monroe michigan custer intends to court her but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away custers legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg while on leave he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth who promises him her hand in matrimony immediately after the war custer and elizabeth bacon are married with the civil war over custer is demoted doesnt get a real command and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general in chief winfield scott custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry which he trains to be an elite unit neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horses cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming the only minus and thats why i cant give this picture a full 10 is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants elizabeths servant callie is the stereotypical overweight good natured superstitious black mammy it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custers overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesnt mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station gettysburg trevilian station and others though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests in any event they died with their boots on is a well made war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de havilland and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldnt be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a 10 if it werent for the racist minstrelization of african americans
the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynns performance is superb this is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold calculating look on flynns face as he does so is extraordinary   much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queens own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards   one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor
now this is more like itone of the best movies i have ever seendespite it made very well on all aspectsthis movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurateloosen upthere are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grandhow entertaining and how captivating this movie wasnow this is what a movie ticket is all aboutyou will get exacty what you want from this movies genre and all naysayers are those with the anti flynn syndromethis conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvisanti alianti clintonanti kennedy syndromesusually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefsif the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from artyou will find this movie not only one of the best classicsbut also one of the best movies of all timei rate it the second best western ever right behind waynes the cowboys
this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custers life and his last stand do not rent `they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch the story starts out with custers errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role  although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the directors portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film
naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clichés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early 20th century for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash its hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life custer  1 his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character 2 his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custers cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid 3 custers promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene 4 custers stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky 5 custers drinking problem is certainly not ignored and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy & co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didnt expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk
as a history of custer this insnt even close custer dies to help the indians i am sure the other members of the 7th cav werent consulted in that decision but as a western this is fun flynn looks and acts the part of the dashing cavalier and the garry owen is always nice to hear
so keira knightly is in itso automatically we compare this film to attonement aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally different the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physches damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved go on give it a go
although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western not only is flynn the perfect custer the character actors are superb besides the action portion of the movie flynn and dehavillands love scenes are very touching and believableflynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well
errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape confederates  indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de havilland as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesnt work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co worked
the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exception it also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strong minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynns later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is rekindled    for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effect the flynn de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this films durability when most of flynns other westerns    held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star    have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboy fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but its a trifle too morally convenient however these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an all but wordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous twinkles flash point indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer high octane charisma hes a reckless braggart but you cant help but like him and its hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter this is one of flynns lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered
this is awesome there is no partnership quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine im 24 yet this flick is as captivating now as im sure it was 60 years ago raoul walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel custer flynn and his wife de havilland almost brought me to tears not easy for a 24yr old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith custer has in taking your glory with you and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de havilland was a screen legend this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest
george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux  when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havillands depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott  arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land 
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn whats not known to todays audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libbys point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point im not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libbys farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivias especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes dont moisten you are made of marble  as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you cant beat this film at all
great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color  wow 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although ive heard that the film isnt very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was ill give this film 10 out of 10
although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
this is a wonderful film as a film   it gets an 8 out of 10 as a filmed piece of accurate historyone wishes to be more loving but it is a 5 out of 10 and i think i am actually being very charitable what was he like   that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes opinionated militant bumptious bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian foe indian friend and national hero his death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and sherman jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career   the overly ambitious hot spur that his reputation declined yet to this day george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our historys military annals to lose his last battle i cant really think of a similar one   maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march   but wainwright survived the march and the second world war  custer has appeared in more films than far better generals due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in 1941 the legend was still potent olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until 1933 so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and approved it so we get the view that he was a hot spur but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by demerits which was true custer was in the class of 1861 and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the confederacy the union needed every northern point man they could find custers civil war career should be given closer study   he was attached to the staff of general   in   chief george b mcclellan and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare but he was a cavalryman   and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and shermans buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley it also hit custer hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen ramseur joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer   mortally wounded custer sat with ramseur all through the latters last night alive following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his brevet   major generalship permanent it wasnt as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in 1866 and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the 1870s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william belknap who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit it ruined belknap and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman who was belknaps former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and immortality arrived that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the 1850s   1876 to the standards of 2007 would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but im not sure wed like it custer 1941 style fit flynn like a glove with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the heros character in support actors like sidney greenstreet stanley ridges arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends foes or even treacherous sneaks kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high   but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be
can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to    extend everyones knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller his feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street brawl and then theres his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera shes caitlins closest friend williams wife and like a muse the star in dylans dark sky it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of his vices he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story its pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you dont want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylans memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her childrens interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth   in the hours in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film the films colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting veras lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but veras lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetrys juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day constant echoes of dylans poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things ill take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died  ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera were still innocent in dylan she says theres a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year
the custer legend a la warner brothers epic theres no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute not only to custer but to the men of the 7th cavalry the story traces the life of the famed boy general from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun
all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii provided you dont take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say jfk this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that its not to be taken as particularly fact based but more of a stylishly semi heroic portrayal its worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film described the biographical account of custers life as fanciful and pointed out that the presentation of custers motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up custer one supposes but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around but appropriately determined principled and inspirational flynn and dehavilland doing their 8th movie together in 7 years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that its not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here with a first time pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael curtiz but given that he had worked with them on the previous years similar themed santa fe trail its understandable if he chose to opt out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade   both terrific   so we cant really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh raoul walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences   which are outstanding   and everything else outdoors the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well as does warner bros outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces greenstreet gene lockhart anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if kennedys character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written   and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as hed only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the genesis of garryowen as the cavalry theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure 8 of 10
dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer the dashing jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless headstrong cadet through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians olivia de havilland flynns co star in several other films scores as the devoted adoring libby bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse the films battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers hammers the confederate army into submission custers last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic
i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins loudens perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the 80s i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonnas character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and genius
nicole finn madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record louden griffin dunne is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law louden will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in laws rolls royce picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector nicki however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns lawyer louden knows hes not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue madonna and dunneare perfect foils to each other making their connection uproarious as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is laudable in its ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy rent this movie for them you will both be cheerio pronto
i have to rate this movie at a 10 im sorry but i think its classic comedy then if youre rating it to other madonna movieswell what you wanna tell me it wasnt her best movie ever didnt mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a+ sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80s remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies id be willing to watch everyday three actually that pep up my day and make me smile if you like whos that girl then id also recommend party girl and romy and michelles high school reunion
i havent been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didnt give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came 3 years before the roberts gere success its a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor i know this doesnt tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun peace gary
nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but thats why i love nikki finn shes not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesnt rob or murder unless youre out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed she knows what to take and what cant be stolen if you need a favor from her shes in 100% bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her whos that girl shes the girl for me
when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but whos that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts ive watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasnt the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight
why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasnt out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80s flick to all the critics just dont take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a goddess
in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer not content with this forever jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people how many people will be interested in a loner 20 something whos best friend is a cat after several failed attempts at getting a girl including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office discos dead says jon he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself  naturally they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat fortunately jons new girlfriend is allergic to cats  with slicker animation than past tv specials this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends
this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im 15 now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why
one of the funniest most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth renting buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography  the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fans o
for late 80s cheese this really isnt so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft   thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars im curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after whos that girl
fantastic madonna at her finest the film is funny and her acting is brilliant it may have been made in the 80s but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block buster i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes fantastic
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who´s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 10 10
if this film had been made in the 50s or 60s critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end its not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchies acting in the film not the best on the planet    but it adds to the films unique slapstick comedy aspirations and showcases madonnas often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an ex convict who was framed for a crime she didnt commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groom puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there *is* one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is
madonna gets into action again and she fails again whos that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people dont want that shes successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was agreat hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth isthat madonna failed as an actress cause the script was quite weak butits not so bad especially for those who like the 80s its such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie  at the end its very funny to watch it
i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like madonnas character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one  my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybodys cup of tea but its their problem not of the film  i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking
whats his name loudon loudon what clear that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didnt commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fiancées father john mcmartin the future father in law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only 8 10 but on the other hand i cant imagine her doing it in her normal voice this film shows madonnas comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée yes its predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more
i love this movie sure i love it because of madonna but who cares   its damn funny *alanis rocks* when i first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987 i thought it was all out hilarious madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky funky look the all time funniest part is when madonnanikki screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi and also when griffin dunneloudentrips and falls at the apartment interview scene **alanis rocks** madonnas character nikki steals shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie   her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time didnt rob nothin when you rob a store you stick up the cashier we busted a few tapes theres a bit of a difference i love that its classic ***alanis rocks*** i dont know why this movie got slammed the way it did i see nothing wrong with it   course maybe if youre a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch whos that girl and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist alanis will always rock ya completely to the end so does madonna in this film and just entirely her acting is superb

dont listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers  no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it its actually a great movie for kids too
i kid you not yes whos that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonnas films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonnas character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonnas best and one of her most underrated films madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didnt commit shes being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together thats when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof  this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy loudens rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunnes stuck up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jakes girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny thats how some of the best comedy should be played   straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game  some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies its still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s not for everyone im sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it  interesting note one of madonnas friends from her early 80s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band
if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast she is cutefunny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays herself in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james foley who filmed the dramatic and haunting at close range with sean penn & christopher walken and co stars griffin dunn after hours who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and dont expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean 80s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs the #1 hit whos that girl the #2 hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of lovetop 10 hit in the uk and cant stop a left over pop ditty from the true blue sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd
so madonna isnt meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w  katherine hepburn bringing up baby for what it is thougha piece of fluff its quite a bit of fun to watch ive yet to hear anyone that slams madonnas acting skills back it up w  evidence or even adjectives other than awful bad or other such vague descriptive words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about whitney houston shes had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldnt act her way out of a hatbox the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so 90s
i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the ziegfield at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in desparately seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium  whos that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the madcap heroine routine better than you might think griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans the story involves a huge cat named murray a bride to be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc a mean father in law and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact  sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything  compared to most madonna movies the ones ive been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad 6 10 ps the concert was lousy
watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine  its sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure its the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation hes very good in a small role as braccos pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie
i loved this movie you cant buy it rent it or find it but its a keeper wonderful chemistry between braccho and walken and ferrar terrific non stop action and reactions loved it ive watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it find this movie and watch it  so many films are on tv over and over again   without any of the wit and style of this little film i didnt know it was made for tv my copy is an 8 track i pirated years ago i hope it lasts
a quite easy to watch tale of 2 thieves with that love hate type relationship between them chrisopher walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than hes letting on
its strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best youve seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women ive ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful youll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a runncoke   i know i did im very glad i saw this movie   it was just too nice to miss
finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed 80s machomovie on a upn affiliates midday saturday program would be misleading it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads best attributes to its maximum advantage bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre do the streetwise troubled minds routine that they are so good at portraying for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuquas training day dive back into the world of early 90s tv movies to find scam
i am a huge fan of harald zwart and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i cant say im a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it bjørn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year  if youre only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one
this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole criteria our culture would be the poorer for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart the point is it is one of the best movies of its type ive seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets waynes world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen joe estevez may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in was that intentional if youre attracted to the box rent the video you wont regret it as is promised it is good non violent erotic fun
is this a bad movie of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindlers list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure 100% adolescent fun there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say againif you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it
i`ve seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in it`s unrated version which is soft core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by b queen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series
this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing   but thats partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can youll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time dont be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal   guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother  while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it its more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end   and possibly beyond
we open in a doctors room of some sort a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor he asks her questions silence follows he continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere the story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an incident that happened before hand they are greeted on their arrival by their trying way too hard to be nice but so totally evil stepmother who the girls obviously hold resentment for as time goes on at home the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls and to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recovery this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points i know i had a teary moment of two specifically the cupboard scene but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits the soundtrack is faultless the furnishings in the house and the use of colour are fantastic a pure joy for the eyes this is a definite must see for all asian movie fanatics or any sort of movie fan an easy 10 10
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen its so full of details and every time you see it youll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they cant do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there arent  i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them
tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what youve seen its a hell of a puzzler
another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning the movie starts pretty simple   two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother   especially the elder one   and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didnt know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as wellas for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister   revealed when the stepmother actually the sisters alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there finally   my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack very creepy 7 out of 10
what can i say about this film that wont give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confusedif youve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere youll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on im not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and dont mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl
disgused as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director ji woon kims decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies a tale of two sisters tels the story as its name suggest of two sisters su mi and the younger su yeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmothers gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so ill just leave it at that the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out ji woon kims focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective su mi the weaker su yeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmothers frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat ji woon kims direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the films horroresque scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with its strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away norway is known for making crappy movies no offensebut i had a good feeling about this one even thou im not interested in football i wanted 2 see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if youre ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one
this movie is something horrible i was laughing all the time i was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought its not polite to laugh when people are dying but in this movie even death looks ridiculous especially when tornado tommy is sucked into one tornado explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called r type dialogues are very bad and i am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie it is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the tv only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity
i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election cbss last shot at throwing a dig at bush this movie was just awful yet im still watching it **minor spoiler** i think cbs got the same people who provided the memos to do the semi cut in half sequence what is with the bad boyfriend storyline can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a ed wood movie who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing if you want to see decent b grade disaster movies then see earthquake flood etc avoid this mess of a movie hint to cbs avoid showing us this crap give us re runs of csi instead better acting and more believable
anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event theres about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland by the book tv drama clichés bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies so im not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if its executed in an amusing fashion what kills this movie is its 10 subplots all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is tornado tommy despite being a very annoying stereotype note that i also didnt bother commenting on special effects their quality should come as no surprise not recommended
if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see this okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring compounded by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid next throw in loads of human interest elements   in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gun wielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intention jeez if you cant even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on twisters exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stations in case you didnt already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly ungratifying implausible manners that stunk more of moralising that good film making im have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed cliché soaked scripts but for gods sake that doesnt mean anyone has to make them into movies it manages to make the abysmally implausible 100 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both
a wasted effort on the surface its a typical disaster movie were involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event however the script is so awful and theres so much explaining of the characters background within the dialogue that we feel were being treated like morons even sesame street didnt explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died we can work it out someone thought that entering enron into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies the acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers randy quaid brian dennehy and after the first hour i couldnt care less about who the storms took out but maybe there are the special effects to watch sadly no even on a 20 year old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer generatedbadly maybe there are budgetary limitations so i can forgive that one footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real but i kept telling myself i had seen that before this site confirms it it was from an earlier film nowhere to land so in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30 second network promo it makes category 6 look quite good my advice rely on your network to do some good 30 second clips watch them and save yourself two nights
i hope that matt dorffs original script for this was much better there are signs of it   dialogue that should happen well before big f x scenes to introduce characters that would make sense much earlier is jammed in later in the time line perhaps the original script was for a longer running time but maybe not    in any case this reeks every character is uninteresting and *everybody* speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god there are characters that are entirely expository    dianne wiests secretary abbot is just awful explaining things to her assistant and incidentally us in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone ever in real life when she isnt explaining things to her assistant that she already knows her assistant explains things to her that she already knows_ there are characters who are entirely one dimensional    the evil power company guy the pilot who will just not shut up about his personal life and concentrate on his job the well meaning power company superdooperuber hacker guy who can crash *everything* in chicago including the phones    and then gives the oh no what have i  done speech but not leave himself a back door the crusading reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a hat the power company shift supervisor who abandons his post in the middle of the worst crisis in chicago since the fire    with no consequences hospitals abandoned by the doctors and nurses during the crisis im not kidding thats in the movie  oh yeah and its filled with hollywood morality clichés    generally women are good men are evil unless influenced by a woman the ultimate is the punk with the gun    deprived of a womans influence he literally goes insane an evil stupid act like what the reporter did with hacker bozo is all right so long as you mean well evil men die capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible everybody else lives well except randy quaid and did i hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there wasnt electricity to run the safety systems think about that one there is one ray of sunshine if youll pardon the expression    randy quaid basically plays his character from independence day you know    hello boys   im baaaack    this time as a storm chaser with an infinite range suv and superdooper batteries for his camcorders nevertheless they kill him    mostly it seems so that the audience will appreciate that tornados are pretty dangerous things kinda shallow that give this one a pass
i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it i dont know why but i ended up watching it the whole 2 hours we have seen this type of movie i dont know how many times back in 1998   2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one here are my problems with this film 1 cheap special effects like something out of the old computer 2 no background information or explanation on weather patterns if you are going to make a movie about weather at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details 3 how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on chicago no more experts left in the field 4 where are some interesting characters i truly dont care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman i felt that there was no character development 5 no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme and this is only the first part of the film i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie i can only imagine what we are to expect of course at the end the main characters will survive and life will go on how original
without doubt one of the worst films ever made sluggish and without structure tension or story the film coasts on the thin premise of putting together a show conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental everything is put together in a slapdash order and often stepping out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie the film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random liza musical numbers shelly winters can be seen in the far superior octo epic tentacles and the real liza can be found in the showtime release of queer duck the movie
a coming of age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures its like watching a religious propaganda movie theisen who has made only one other movie is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired director and co writer nesheim who has worked mostly in tv is not up to the task
as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles magical mystery tour the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie called head both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though mmt attempted to define a plot as they are a hodge podge of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and out takes head has no plot other than the pre fab four trying to break free of the box they are in ie the type casting of being monkees and the surrounding commercialism and yet always finding themselves back in the box most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other seemingly unrelated scenes filled with anti vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents the film bounces around haphazardly  also to be blamed on the multiple directors the film like magical mystery tour is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements phooey like mmt it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap like mmt head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through but it is not ironic at all that like everything else the monkees did this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first even when it comes to laying an egg
the james dean story is introduced as a different kind of motion picture explaining the presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique   dynamic exploration of the still photograph the only tape recordings of his voice noteworthy is one short recording mr dean make while visiting his family in indiana he wanted to record any family recollections of his great grandfather cal dean intrigued because he played a similarly named cal in east of eden dean asks if cal dean was interested in art and learns the relative was an auctioneer james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family obviously thats the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family an amazing screen test outtake from east of eden appears near the films end its a black and white scene between dean as cal trask and co star richard davalos as aron trask dean is at his mesmerizing best if this scene appeared only here and no east of eden film was completed this documentary would be an essential high rated film but the scene a perfect 10 in isolation should be considered an east of eden extra deans traffic safety film is also worth seeing there are the expected interviews with family and friends my favorites were the guy lew bracker going through a box of stuff dean left with him and deans family there wasnt enough from aunt ortense and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice more reading of deans letters would have been welcome deans unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus robert altmans direction of martin gabels reading of stewart sterns script is dreadful what were they thinking perhaps filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of deans passing dont expect the james dean story at all this movie is more about deans effect on people both the fans and filmmakers than the man it is very clearly an early piece of the james dean myth making legend tommy sands sings let me be loved the narrative refers to dean as he with a god like air the shots of deans family seeming to know the moment he dies are truly wretched ** the james dean story 8 13 57 robert altman ~ james dean martin gabel richard davalos
this was a sordid and dreary mess i needed a shower when it was over it goes something like this  some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women whats surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and yucky ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross dressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a one star rating
lets get right to the heart of the matterthis is a terrible movie the story is confusing the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss poor ellen looks like shes in pain barkins talent is totally wasted in this b grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film
 very slow plodding movie with a confusing story line the movies only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much younger peta wilson not sure what this movie was about
this contains some spoiler information but the movie is not worth watching anyway why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer director damian harris is beyond me the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients   and he sleeps with them all even more over the top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s m crime belong to a large yet secret group of s m lesbian executives full of bad editing and continuity errors the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations   including barkins detective salary apartment and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep  damian is a bad writer and a bad director he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times furthermore he couldnt get ellen barkin to give 110% i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying  standouts were peta wilson who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part the highly under rated character actor marshall bell gave his absolute best as always and since damian couldnt deliver on any level it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters  most importantly he doesnt know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical hollywood reality of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous save your time money and braincells and pass this one by
as much as i love ellen barkin who is really underrated i have to boo this movie if you cant tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho sexual thriller or have never watched 20 20 its like the filmmakers and actors didnt care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway overall this movie serves to turn on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex not a fun movie to sit through although if you like ellen barkin its nice to see her place a tough lady
this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere subplots come in and out of nowhere the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killers motivation is unclear to say the least maybe they could get away with this in a porn version but here some more clarification is needed
mercy the movie actually starts out as a somewhat decent film and ellen barkin does give a strong performance but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare it is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing 3 out of 10
than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie wouldve lasted a bit longer but it wouldve been worth it at least for me casting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky not much more to say really but i really wish theyve concentrated a bit more on the less obvious 
i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies but not when its supposed to be a crime drama thing the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball i started fast forwarding to see how it ended and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it the main character played by ellen barkin just wasnt believable at all peta wilson acted very well in this film but her character was way out there and there wasnt anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work
at a saturday matinee in my home town i went with an older friend he was about 12 and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok its rated g i was assaulted by loud music strange images no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense we left halfway through because we were bored frustrated and our ears hurt  i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre my opinion had changed  its even worse basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60sand has dated badly i got all the little in jokestoo bad they werent funny the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and theres absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on some people will love this i found it frustratingby the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen also all the monkees songs in this movie suck and i do like them for ex hippies onlyor if youre stoned i give this a 1
this film tried but ultimately it was a waste of talent it tried to hard to be sexy im not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson who will find something besides tvs le femme nikita worthy of her talents i just didnt find even in ms wilsons so called near seduction scene with mrs barkin any real emotion even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work if the sexual elements of wilsons disturbed sex victim didnt touch our heart which it didnt even by an ending it didnt deserve neither did the murder element of the plot perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but i didnt feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesnt work for me if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out 1 the gulity pleasure of bound which works well in a noir setting and 2 the more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hells kitchen called all over me its a well defined indie from the mid 90s that handles that coming of age issue with feeling not forced sexuality both would be a better rental than mercy which has next to nothing
i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the missing eyelids as the camera pans up and away from her face blinks yes blinks i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things of course after that it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body face too bad
i caught this on hbo under its category of guilty pleasures and i would agree that i felt guilty and pleasured watching it one its trash and really raunchy trash two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think so what however i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times do i feel dirty for having watched it yes am i sorry i watched it no so theres the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy even when in a poor movie sigh
first of all even imdb is slacking with this movie as the list of cast is very gappy even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example now back to the movie i love watching movies but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes it was horrid probably the worst movie i have ever seen and the reason why it bothers me so much is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand the plot line itself is good it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting golden brooks was a huge disappointment i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud fun loving energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends melodramatic roles are not for her at all she basically killed her character rachel i love some of the cast like deborah cox mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson but even they couldnt save this catastrophic movie of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man and he didnt help me get to like him more here either golden brooks voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint the director i wont even waste board space on he did such a bad job the editing photography camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad not to mention the dialogs absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself  as i said it could have been a very nice movie but it was seriously messed up i would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematography major and want to see a what not to do example for their future work have a great day everyone
i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966 still am one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters encounter at farpoint fails in its mission superbly produced poorly directed written acted dc fontana really blew this one this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned the first half of the first season didnt fare much better
the series does not start as it means to go on although its first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes as well as numerous duds afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born the first ever episode of star trek the next generation is remarkable for two things its hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast and marina sirtis peculiar accent which would later disappear seeing how it all began is very satisfying and viewed in mind of the rest of the series rather moving actually otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q and some giant jellyfish thats right
zipperface is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid mansour pormand ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time if however you love bad films see this at all costs
the first thing you should know about zipperface is that it was shot on video so it has that peculiar home video ish look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a real film and zipperface indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a real serial killer thriller its not quite that but its not as bad as it looks either having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role   her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end the red herrings appear ludicrous at first but ultimately they work   i guessed the killer incorrectly and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of the gimp for pulp fiction *1 2
wow this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs lord knows theyd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie terrible acting the killer is quite far from scary ive seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier lots of unnecessary skin in this film pseudo porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this i dont think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone
creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend but as is the case with many of the genres clichés   the italians did it first movies like eyeball torso and blood and black lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery there were also a couple of american pre halloween slashers that warrant a mention classroom massacre keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly pre date 1978 whilst the town that dreaded sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen kill movies  carpenters seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen over the years weve seen some memorable contenders but my favourites would have to be my bloody valentines maniacal miner the prowlers sadistic soldier and wicked games copper faced assassin im also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmens costumes a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion which of course doesnt exactly make for a scary disguise but in later years both blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit heres how the later of the two fared  the screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation it seems that a stressed out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low brow turkeys so hes decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint detective shine david clover manages to wrestle with the gunman but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like its the end of the road for the grey haired officer fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from lisa ryder donna adams the california police departments hottest female law enforcer her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts meanwhile a leather clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners ryder and shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker john mandell lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police regulation doesnt seem to apply to her so before long shes dating the cameraman even though hes suspect numero uno when the bodies continue to pile up around the city she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the s & m madman  if anything zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein what started as a great stepping stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic line ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes unfortunately by this point in the cycle titles like rush week deadly dreams and the majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned features characters ended up in an early grave donna adams doesnt even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour   which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation   is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be mansour pourmand couldnt direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial i searched and searched but found nothing here of merit or note on the plus side if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killers identity to be honest though i doubt that by that time youll even care and another plus point well erm the disc is perfectly symmetrical which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon aside from that theres really no other reason to go out and buy zipperface bad bad bad and not in a good way this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest hair abysmal
the monkees head is one of those peculiar phenomenons ive noticed  that when something doesnt make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended such is the case here the movie is a stream of consciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches blackouts set pieces etc similar to the ones on their tv show but while the tv show was played for laughs this doesnt seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep trippy pseudo intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes all in all its the monkees doing the same schtick but now its consciousness raising because the laugh track is removed there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing it just drones on with colored lights the music in head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability the tunes are mostly garbage the only one thats even listenable is porpoise song which opens and closes the film but the thing is that was a gerry goffin carole king song and while its above average for the monkees its below average by goffin and king standards its like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them you might think its a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize its a throwaway mike nesmiths song is maybe passable the rest is worthless davy jones has i guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since its the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isnt any good i have to admit i always liked the monkees so the movie is a real disappointment sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about it they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it but then they got ambitious in head they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product but the truth is they wanted something more they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists maybe not like the beatles but something approaching that head proves that they failed on all counts 1* out of 4
heftig og begeistret intense and enthusiastic is a documentary like story of a male choir up in berlevåg in the very northern part of norway where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves the people in the choir who are aged from 30 to 95 all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to murmansk the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet thei r livingrooms the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings everything is as real as can be it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story it is very beautiful and real but why do we see it is it because of the songs is it because of the nature or is it simply just to see a story about berlevåg mens choir about their life and some of the trips they have the message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir the choir have kept the people together for many many years it is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost 200000 in norway there is something wrong there is no beginning or end to it nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great why was this movie made i am sorry it is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average european scandinavian or norwegian movie   this does not deserve a 9 out of 10 it is closer to 4 out of 10 and that is what i will give it if you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55 60 it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb it is a movie about elders for elders it is a movie of i regret nothing in my life and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevåg might be a nice life too
i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort so why was this film made i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope brotherhood and inspiration with this all male choir but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table let me pose this question to you do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest my answer is yes and this is where jensen failed heftig og begeistret was a good documentary but it was far from great jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects it was great to hear the songs but over time those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow i knew that i was hooked but as the film developed i lost interest why jensen never took us the audience members to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never know again i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created jensen gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that i knew nothing about by the end of the film in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his drivers license we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an ex drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years did jensen develop these interesting stories at all nope he left them on the table it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing to me the music was defined at the beginning of the film i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men they were all captivating yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end without giving the ending away i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion nervousness or sadness jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway but for everyone else watching ie me more was necessarily needed i wanted to feel for these guys i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city there was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects when you watch modern documentaries oddly this film was made in 2001 you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film you want suspense realism and drama alas with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort overall i must ask the question again why was this film made my final answer alex is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population with that said jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary when you make a film of this nature i feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed again i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but i needed more with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us i want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine  grade ** out of *****
this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show thats more famous than this one from what i see none of you havent mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50s 60s called secret agent man the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan the prisonerbraveheartice station zebrathe phantom etc a man who was tapped to be the first james bond but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bonds bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values this show was done in black and white and its a pity for those who havent seen ityou are missing out on a lot the character mr mcgoohan played in secret agent man was named drake and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called the prisoner the character he played in the prisoner was that of a agent whos identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service and on this island the populace dont have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is 6 it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50s and 60s pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show youre very wrong about that it was johnnys and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid well in england it was actually called danger man and in the us it was retitled secret agent man for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired granted this current show has little to do with the original no such main character named drake in this one and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of secret agent man but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series
ive watched hundreds of kung fu movies and ive heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making ive ever seen i cant help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some civility this movie just has half evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self respect the narrators character shouldve be killed for sucking so muchshe really didnt deserve to live til the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they shouldve just rename this movie to the stupid one armed caveman with a blade heres a questionwhy do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the deficiencies of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung fu moviesor any taste in movies
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen its supposed to be a remake or update of the one armed swordsman by chang cheh the ham fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes arent even worth watching the script tries desperately hard to seem serious but is full of cliches like and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again or if only id known what a heavy price i would have to pay ugh and who is that girl who plays sing someone find her and have her eliminated shes awful if you like chinese martial arts movies youd be better off with lau gar leung this stinks
ive heard a lot about the inventive camera work and direction in this movie i thought both were a mess also some truly terrible acting the main heroine in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation everything she does or says is stupid and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up if she could fight i might forgive her overall all the women in this movie are stereotypical broads in need of a man to save them and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no one this is a poor movie and i urge you to avoid it watch something like the sword of doom instead i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film
as jennifer denuccio used to say on square pegs gag me out the door i would definitely vote this movie on imdbs worst movie list dennis christopher plays tt a guy from chicago who goes to california peddling his brothers jazz records he is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals only surfing community but he acts more like he is new to civilization just try to get through his sex scene without squirming there are also the on going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure that of duke seymour cassell the volleyball expert who tries to get tt to act like a normal human being the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months california dreaming is just a big old mess it starts out like a typical seventies romp complete with bad 70s music even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s and dennis christopher comes off as the most irritable loser it makes the movie hard to watch keep your finger on the fast forward button even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture the surf scenes are almost total garbage the people at the surf contest look as though they cant keep from falling asleep i guess the only cool thing is seeing tanya roberts outside of her role as midge on the sitcom thats 70s show and cassell wasnt bad he was just in a bad movie
seymour cassel gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke slusarski will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brothers dreams what he gets is lame surf hijinks guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman next time my woman talks back i will pretend im spiking the ball  back to seymour cassel the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball the best hes played in over ten years the way the scene is shot is beautiful you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time 3 10 bad to fair the rest of the movie was lame
two little girls strike a friendship one tries to convince the other shes a witch the other is a pushover who bends to the would be witchs will on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls with many a dramatic cut away as they pose shocking questions you know the kind sweet little children shouldnt ask such as how do you make a deal with the devil oooh creepy in the end the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end but by the time it comes you wont care in the least i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican moviegoer but it doesnt even hold up as a charming relic it merely drags on it is boring it is pointless it is not to be watched there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it based on their knowledge of the directors other works and of course that common denominator everyone says about pointless films ah the cinematography is wonderful those reviewers probably have a point but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge who dont care about its photography its atmosphere or itswhatever else it has    for these viewers then who just want a *good* movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half do yourselves a favour folks  skip it
as i sit and think about poison for the fairies i realize that i may not being fair with the film my rating of 3 10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value based on the plot description reviews on imdb and the 76 imdb rating i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem sadly it just didnt do much for me for whatever reason poison for the fairies all but put me to sleep poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city one of the girls veronica is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she veronica is a witch the other girl flavia is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her thats really about it in reality nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia one commenter on imdb described it as the scariest film in 80s mexican cinema my comment  if thats the case there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the 80s another commenter wrote watch it if you wanna get scared my comment  are you sure were talking about the same movie my opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples ive given to me it was dull uninspired and poorly acted the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos enrique taboada doesnt ever show the faces of any of the other characters veronica and flavia carry on long drawn out conversations with members of their families and their teacher but we never actually see these peoples faces its an annoying gimmick
this is a poor excuse for a movie a film noir done by busbee berkeley please first lets forget about the plot a truly simple minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde yechh so what turns her from despising him to loving him along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off stranding them it isnt exactly heroics but shes suddenly smitten its truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hard bitten tough talking noir type cop a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a growling voice most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles how he ever got talked into taking this job ill never understand enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas pumps but dont expect a decent film experience it wasted 1 1 12 hours of my life
the mad monster starts in dr lorenzo camerons george zucco laboratory as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his dim witted servant petro glenn strange apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters the ultimate soldier however first things first as dr cameron has his sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed his experiments forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule dr cameron puts his plan into action & uses his monstrous creation to murder professor blaine robert strange in an unfortunate turn of events dr cameron is unable to control the beast & is spotted by a local farmer jed harper eddie holden who spreads the news like wildfire in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named tom gregory johnny downs gets wind of the story & starts to investigate he starts to suspect dr cameron & since gregory is going out with his daughter lenora ann nagel he has plenty of opportunity to sniff around directed by sam newfield this is really low budget stuff from the 40s even worse its dull unoriginal low budget stuff the script by fred myton drags the extremely thin premise out to almost 77 minutes which is far too long there is no variety in the story & its basically the same thing over & over the characters are dull clichés the mad scientist who conducts pointless experiments that create a monster the fragile pretty daughter the reporter who plays the hero & by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for & is romantically involved with his daughter the dumb servant stupid idiotic police & stereotypical shotgun wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk this was probably clichéd even back in 1942 the film plods along at a fairly slow pace & director newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing technically the film isnt great obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who hasnt shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth the black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good dr camerons laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top the acting is stiff & wooden with petro looking like hes on dope throughout the entire film zucco as the mad scientist doesnt convince & is forgettable the mad monster is a pretty lame horror film there is very little here to entertain although at least i made it through to the end in a single sitting which when i think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself
not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie the mad ghoul the mad monster is a film that zucco appeared in the year before in this fairly paint by numbers affair zucco perfects a way to turn his dim witted handyman petro into a wolf man hybrid by means of wolfs blood injections and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments it is a very simple plot really and an extremely low budget production glenn strange who plays the man wolf here would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as house of frankenstein 1944 and abbott and costello meet frankenstein 1948 the makeup job on him here is pretty lame and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth like the one in 1957s teenage monster the sets in this film in addition are fairly nonexistent and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films but truth to tell most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap and i suppose it is its certainly no well crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece thats for sure still zucco is always fun to watch even in undemanding piffle such as this if you can spare 72 minutes of your life i suppose you could do worse than the mad monster not too much worse of course ohone other thing this dvd is from alpha video and you know what that means fuzzy images lousy sound indeed the worst sound of any alpha video dvd ive encountered so far and no extras youve been warned
george zucco was a fine actor often playing gimlet eyed villains with a lascivious intensity however even he couldnt save this dull and flat footed b flick zucco plays the usual mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron who believes that wolfs blood injected into humans can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win the world war ii go figure experimenting on pedro the handymanglenn strange zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches pedro is obviously based on lennie from of mice and men and you almost keep expecting him to say duh okay george theres one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian   very pedestrian   77 minute tread through all the old clichés that are done far better in other movieswe also get the revenge motif from the devil bat worked in in itself a borrowing from son of frankenstein zucco is wasted and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes the mummys hand and dr renaults secret to see how wasted a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer really and the scene where zucco demonstrates his wolf man technique to those who doubted him again shades of dr jekyll and mr hyde is unintentionally hilarious not one of the better 40s b movies
for reasons i cannot begin to fathom dr lorenzo cameron george zucco begins injecting wolfs blood into his dim witted handyman petro glenn strange the result  petro is transformed into a hideous as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be killer beast dr cameron uses petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas and why wouldnt they dr camerons nuttier than a fruitcake overall the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller theres really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone his dr cameron is a regular loony he has no qualms about killing he has entire conversations with people who arent there and as with most mad scientists he messes in gods domain actually im not sure anyone accuses him of this but it fits but beyond zucco theres nothing here to recommend everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster
pretty bad prc cheapie which i rarely bother to watch over again and its no wonder    its slow and creaky and dull as a butter knife mad doctor george zucco is at it again turning a dimwitted farmhand in overalls glenn strange into a wolf man unfortunately the makeup is virtually non existent consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part if it were not for zucco and stranges presence along with the cute anne nagel this would be completely unwatchable strange who would go on to play frankensteins monster for unuiversal in two years does a lenny impression from of mice and men it seems *1 2 of four
there are so many holes in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i dont know much about george zucco but ive seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the loving father mad scientist vampire guy he looks so ordinary im surprised that he ended up in the genre this is the typical i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army by transferring wolf blood or is it coyote to his hired hand he turns him into a werewolf glen strange who was one of karloffs successors as the frankenstein monster plays the kindly lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor at first the scientist is able to control when petro his name can be transformed but like the invisible man suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice golly miss brooks she wants to leave but her father the doctor wont allow that he is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on petro and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked its not a very good movie the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the spanish moss once again the townsfolk are a bunch of morons who look like they escaped from a bad western one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era theres also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her
first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general its not that i dont like them just that i dont like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyedwerewolf of london 1935 stuart walker an american werewolf in london 1981 john landisand some that i have thought were okay but nothing specialthe wolf man 1941 george waggner the howling 1981 joe dante dog soldiers 2002 neil marshall are some examplesbut overall the werewolf sub genre is not my favorite but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought id give it a watch and see how it was spoilers follow the mad monster is a werewolf tale but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron george zucco dr cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts specifically wolves but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community forced out of a prestigious position he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter lenora the lovely anne nagel and his assistant petro glenn strange of limited mental abilities using his serum dr cameron transforms petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals eventually though the werewolf petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed the movie also plays out somewhat as a murder crime drama with lenoras journalist suitor johnny downs investigating the doctors strange behavior and the rash of murders the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it there are reminders of frankenstein 1931 james whale in the creation of a monster which runs amok and the creature killing an innocent child visions of dr jekyll and mr hyde 1931 rouben mamoulian or the 1941 victor fleming version and the wolf man 1941 george waggner also come to mind and that is one of the problems with this movie in my view it comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films it doesnt add much to the genre true there are some redeeming qualities george zuccos performance was convincing and the scene showing dr lorenzo talking to his visions hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity there is some reasonable character build up at least in the case of his character but glenn stranges character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comedic quality whether intentional or not im not sure that just doesnt fit into the movie as a whole i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 4 10 but it was still a below average film perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930s and 1940s horror films but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not
dr cameron a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf like creatures originally developing this formula to help the world the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his ouster from the scientific community the scientists daughter lenora grows wary of her fathers actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter when the scientist loses control of his creature it falls upon the scientists daughter and the reporter to stop it according to the dvd sleeves synopsis mad scientist george zucco as lorenzo cameron creates his formula rather unimaginatively by mixing human and wolf blood this brings the beast out in hulking glenn strange as petro aka pedro who is directed to act like lon chaney jr in of mice and men johnny downs as tom gregory and anna nagel as lenora cameron are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress certainly the mad monster is no substitute for the wolf man but its a serviceable addendum the grainy black and white photography enhances the foggy cow webbed atmosphere god uncredited strikes up a well done ending too like blaine robert strange said mingling the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege  **** the mad monster 1942 sam newfield ~ george zucco johnny downs anna nagel
thankfully you dont need a lot of book learnin to understand where this things going obviously a poverty row cash in on universals big hit the wolf man which was made just one year earlier this finds the always watchable george zucco in another of his patented mad doctor roles as brilliant vengeance minded scientist lorenzo cameron cameron who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what im presuming is the louisiana bayou is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job you see they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during war time thankfully cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections   a hulking child like half wit named petro glenn strange petro is pretty clueless as to whats going on doesnt ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe this results in a time lapse change of man turning into a werewolf cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway so you basically get a big guy strange was 65 dressed in overalls with a bushy beard hairy paws and a set of over sized plastic teeth running around in the woods the majority of the time after an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down dr cameron who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect also drags petro along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process also hanging around the house is camerons daughter lenora anne nagel as well as lenoras nosy reporter boyfriend tom johnny downs whose first inclination is that theyre dealing with an upright walking prehistoric creature  though a typically chintzy prc flick in many ways with unimpressive sets cinematography and make ups as well as a fairly bland supporting cast it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star george zucco i have no clue why downs received top billing he shows up half an hour in and really doesnt have a whole lot to do nor is he all that impressive doing it this is zuccos show all the way and hes great ranting and raving talking to himself while fantasizing that hes talking to his peers im not interested in your imbecilic mouthings and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slow talking semi retarded country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of lon chaney jr from his turn as lenny in of mice and men to his performance as the aforementioned wolf man in any case strange and zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another my favorite part is when zucco calls him his guinea pig in front of a colleague while petro just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob some of the foggy swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric too
ok ive now seen george zucco in at least four separate horror suspense films recently as i worked my way through various 50 pack collections and i have to say the guy had a limited range but he was good at what he did he wasnt karloff but prc was lucky to have him  but the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back water ghetto of horror films and he wasnt good enough to take them to the next level of interestnot with the thread bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under thats the case here  this movie is well slow stodgy and unexciting for the most part the heroine seems to be doomed to be a rent a center version of judy garland the hero is bland as white rice and the poor guy playing the monster doesnt even get a good transformation scene out of the deal his make up effects arent scary at all   he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand is all  its not a total waste zucco looks good on camera he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow there are some moody b&w shots here and there that dont completely suck  so all in allthis movie helped some c through z level actors pay their rent for another month and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality watch it once if you like george zucco or just feel the need to see every wolfman themed movie ever made
i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new wave who wasnt unfortunately what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new wave a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty  just say no indeed in more ways than one including to watching this film i couldnt bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether
ok this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments but there are a couple of items i wish to add the mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that fine but the animal in the cage is a coyote that would make a werecoyote did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote theyre easy to tell apart thats weak secondly this movie was covered in the third episode of mst3k on the comedy channel it took joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam and they werent up there quite yet on this one they did add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end but it was not one of their better episodes they never even mentioned the glaring omission of an actual wolf and that joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be smacked
a scientist george zucco wants to create wolf men out of american soldiers to fight the nazis but is branded as mad he uses a simpleton gardener glenn strange to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf strange constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of lon chaney jr in of mice and men has no idea whats going on only that he sleepwalks the victims begin to pile up including a little girl which modern viewers might find rather disturbing and two of zuccos rivals there is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature still prevalent today and play god zuccos motives may be honorable but his methods are most questionable and then there is his daughter anne nagel who is sympathetically nice to strange yet has no idea of her fathers deeds johnny downs is a reporter who gets on zuccos bad side by questioning him but wins nagels heart thus creating the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror films at 77 minutes this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror film of the early 40s particularly one out of prc who released this one so the romantic story could have been trimmed for costs and to speed things up a bit zucco fortunately is never hammy he left that to bela lugosi who always hammed in a deliciously theatrical manner which endeared him to audiences and englands todd slaughter but try not to think of bride of the monsters laboratory while looking at the one zucco works in or some of lugosis dialogue in that now classic cult film mad monster lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad just has dull pacing in more than a few spots for prc and monogram lovers i would recommend the corpse vanishes or fog island higher than this
george zucco was like boris karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance the mad monster is no exception to that rule it is by all standards a poor if entertaining film the filmmakers obviously didnt know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days still zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist the film itself is enjoyable on a camp level normal horror movie fans for the most part wont take a liking to prc films however these poverty row productions have a small but loyal cult following occasionally they would rise above their limitations with detour being the best example of this usually they looked like this for all its technically poor qualities the mad monster is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon the dvd from retromedia is recommended as it pairs this with another prc production the black raven the original theatrical trailer and best of all an interview with glenn strange talking about his role in this movie 4 10
im working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set i am sure that george zucco was a good actor but this was only the second film in which i saw him the first being dead men walk in which he played two parts however even good acting couldnt save the mad monster zucco plays a mad scientist dr cameron who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another in this case like so many others of its ilk it is a transfusion of i assume wolfs blood into humans his goal is to create an invincible army which he can control through the antidote the subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this snail paced classic to almost a full stop  beyond his experiments dr cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him using his transformed gardener however he loses control of his subject who begins to transform without the transfusion    yikes  the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stop action   makeup effects no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time but in todays digital age its hard to imagine audiences being scared by this
a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek quiet but very large gardener in order to prove an hypothesis so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature island of dr moreau frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated goofy morality play though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best this film is not too poorly made and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time like most mad scientist films this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature it doesnt have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein but it doesnt ever extend its reach anyway the acting is passable as is the cinematography and the film moves along at an entertaining clip some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous but hey its just a movie   and a b minus one at that there are also a few nice shots of a wolf and a smattering of humor tossed in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously   always a plus for this genre
this has got to be the most god awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched it makes mel brooks movies oscar worthy by comparison jim vanbebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as the texas chainsaw massacre or night of the living dead the production value is not in question it is vanbebbers ability to cast and present a plausible story line the casting is deplorable for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair never mind that this actors hair came halfway down his back mansons never went much past his shoulders this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that steve railsback or even jeremy davies lent to their portrayals of manson the actor chosen to play tex watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the manson case knows he looks like a minnesota farmer on little house on the prairie the actress playing susan atkins has a butt wider than oprahs while those familiar with the family members know that clem was considered somewhat retarded the actor portraying him did so in such a campy chaplinesque way it was like watching an old vaudevile act instead of sharon tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman the actress looked like bloated alcoholic trailer trash vanbebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasnt proved remotely useful since the munsters the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we arent sure who they are sometimes facts are destroyed in this movie as well lotsapoppa did not die in real life steven parent was shot four times not twice abagail folger did not have her throat slit where were mary brunner and bruce davis during the himnan murder patricia krenwinkel never sported a dorothy hamill hair style the most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day freaks had to do with this movie why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached what was their problem with the journalist what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation why were they included period the viewer never knows  holy mackerel i could go on and on but space prevents it dont try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say what the f   
i heard legends about this film quotes used so as not to insult films for a while so when i finally got the dvd with it i impatiently started watching it by the end i *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic ineptly made nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker this may be the worst film ive even touched   and i used to be associated with troma for a while manson family makes the bottom of tromas entries look like daring and groundbreaking art house filmwork i could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a plot it has the revoltingly bad acting the painful inept directing the sets and props with their dollar ninety nine look i especially loved the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage i think it was supposed to represent a drug induced hallucination i have absolutely no idea how a drug induced hallucination looks or feels nor do i want to find out   but i guess drug junkies with burned out brains will love this film they seem to be the ones who made it ive seen many films from various worst 50 lists traditionally opened by eddie woods ones   and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber or whatever his name is i certainly dont want to remember it ive never seen superbabies or its sequel but i strongly wish that manson joined them on imdbs rating fortunately this obscure garbage probably wont be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many 1 votes   and so much the better
i got encouraged to watch this film because ive heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz well i am disturbed because i spent money on it and i am shocked that something so god awful actually got released thats about it this is a supposed new look at charles mansons family of insane loser junkies and their murders but if this is a new look then its probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all there was something about a manson tape delivered to a radio dj or a tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in 69 then the polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley i kid you not and then it ended thank god dont ask me to make any sense of that im just recalling what i saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make a convincing manson get a short skinny scrawny bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him theres your manson but this manson doesnt even look right he just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black or maybe thats what this film is actually about mansons family didnt make any sense so this film doesnt make any sense either its symbolic yeah right im still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it its not even worth renting ps the recent us tv production helter skelter got bad reviews here but i saw it last month i saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to manson family that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless and i was disappointed in it thats how bad manson family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect
the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter taking a look at the manson family from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea however trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork    and this aint it presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay this film was done in a faux documentary style with reenactments thrown in trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on worse theres an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time all in all this movie is one big wasted opportunity the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc pitman who plays tex who in real life did most of the actual killing whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks pitman manages to convey real feeling in short dont bother with this movie
okay last night august 18th 2004 i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival heres what i have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie ive ever seen second of all in a short q & a session after the show mr van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van bebbles take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and im assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so i had second dibs on questions i asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f*** you shut the f*** up this is the truth all those other movies are bullsh** well anyway i didnt even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film youve heard the laws side of the storynow hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in gods name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock n roll mind of a man who couldnt even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the publics image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlies work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** moviesetc etc case in point even the disclaimer based on a true story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead all i can say is this when the film ended i got a free beer so im glad i went but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question peace
black and white satire of a madison avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks theyre headed by putney swope arnold johnson who is determined to change things however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors thats about as original as this gets im sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today the jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget how is this funny cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters its done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to takeor understand the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along the ending comes out of nowhere to make it worse with the sole exception of johnson all the acting is bad antonio fargas a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the arab this gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color are amusing and theres a rare good line here and there i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good skip itunless youre in experimental 1960s films
strikes me as routine as far as tv movies go i can believe that its based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills for instance good old john ritter now a rather bulky and bearded villain poisons his wife enough to make her ill then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately fourteen years pass before the story picks up again why fourteen years i would guess that though the narrative doesnt demand it history does some of the particular scenes however are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer pawing through her attic helgenberger ritters first wife stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black and white flashbacks with stings on the score    suddenly she recalls when fourteen years ago she discovered ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier carefully collecting them and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner or whatever its called later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well frankly i dont believe it i dont believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner selenium is referred to in the movie as a toxic metal and i suppose it is in sufficient quantity but its also an anti oxidant thats sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed someone will have to demonstrate    as no one does in this movie    that it is a topical poison many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed so how come some selenium in her shampoo gives marg helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup i think the anthropologist e b tylor called this simple minded idea sympathetic magic but im not sure mais je divage anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter who plays the villain with all the stops out    when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at helgenberger who has prompted the investigation you see helgenberger was good friends with ritters second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner ill bet and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritters marital schedule sure the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective mauser    lawrence dane everyone else acts by the numbers they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing but dane does little things that are original im told you want to report a murder long pause while he sits down and waits then abruptly thrusts his face towards helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice so who was murdered i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life i mean what the heck ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and helgenbergers character is dead so who is to object i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals    let me see selenium cyanide a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else    that i was confused by it all not that i was rooting for ritter heres a mathematician with a phd who insists people call him doctor he even corrects people who address him merely as professor most phds get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly jes call me whitey even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you dont average tv fare
one of the most boring movies ive ever seen three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their love of each other they dont seem to be interested in much but each other and only passively so i was left feeling shut out most of the exterior scenes take place at night so one cant even enjoy well lit sights of paris i gave up after an hour and ten minutes
this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend from then on she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends jack during the day and joseph during the night this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture there are only three main actors all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances the wardrobe designer doesnt seem to have much to do as the actors wear very down to earth clothes and actually most of the time they are naked anyway the film is very dialog heavy which should have made up for the shortcomings described above however the dialogs sound too composed and awkward in the beginning of the film most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence and then the person says me too after the frenzy of agreement the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful this film is a great disappointment
i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish akermans direction is both heavy handed and cliched how much more cliched can you get than paris at night the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to egon schieles angst ridden self portraits yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are
this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb armand assante once again doing a poor stallone imitation is ray wellman a ex con just out on parole all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy played by a young marcia gay harden back unfortunately for ray lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot played by sam neill further complicating matters is that rays old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen ray and elliot team up despite mutual dislike what follows is violent and slow but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future shes not as polished here but her raw emotion sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching almost rent fever no the title doesnt fit the film if your a fan of hers otherwise skip it and be grateful its stars went on to better things note this is a hard r flick for language violence and nudity
i was expecting born to kill to be an exciting high tension film noir instead its got two good action set pieces one at the beginning and one at the end and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse usually a glamor cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir but the rest of the film is pretty boring lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but its a strictly by the numbers performance mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after dillinger an overrated movie but at least better than this claire trevors character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal and the action such as it is stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling its one of those movies in which the supporting players    notably elisha cook jr whose characters homoerotic itch for tierneys is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script and isabel jewell    out act the leads it also doesnt help that nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in psycho tierneys is so gross and obvious he might as well have psycho tattooed on his forehead also theres no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called deadlier than the male    but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film born to kill is a real disappointment from robert wise who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career
fellow giallo fanatics beware and or proceed with caution  for this movie isnt exactly what it appears to be it surely looks like a giallo with its juicy vhs cover showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast john phillip & fernando rey but its basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot the version i watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still theres a severe lack of suspense character development and most of all sadistic and typically giallo carnage eyes behind the wall can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues its an interesting effort notwithstanding because writer director giuliano petrelli his only film clearly attempted to do something special but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame inspired by hitchcocks rear window the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair bound writer he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road the tenant respectively likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex then theres also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls are there any normal characters in the story well no of course not the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography but none of it ever leads anywhere so its all just sleaze & sex without significance theres a truly bizarre twist revelation at the end of the story but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality not recommended to fans of italian horror cult cinema but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students to analyze the characters freud style
im almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention the script is sub standard its easy to see why vidal tried to disown it the direction is worse most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un erotic porn more prevalent obviously in the uncut version the cinematography is especially sub par giving the whole production a cheap washed out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs the movie shouldve looked a whole lot better the overall concept of placing name actors in what wouldve easily been an x rated movie guccione called it paganography wears thin after the first hour after peter otoole and john guilgud exit bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid 79s bbc production of i claudius instead and if you want porn jeeze louise look somewhere else
i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous the scenery is ponderous and gaudy the acting for the most part is terrible i do think peter otoole did a good job of acting tiberius but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie john gielgud howsoever brief his appearance in the movie still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome the guy who played claudius looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves picture of claudius the climactic  assassination of caligula wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open air area when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the domus flaviana that still exists today there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it  merciful distractions if you want history read suetonius or tacitus if you want pornography and sadism watch passolinis salo but by all means stay away from this movie
caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 fellini satyricon with bizarre sights freakishness and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the glory of ancient rome but fellini it aint first of all it is not as entertaining far too much screen time is devoted to bug eyed rubber faced mcdowell in the titular role his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing the portrayals by jay robinson in the robe 1953 and david cain haughton in emperor caligula 1983 are far more persuasive and believable with the latter being the most nuanced relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully as it is they are little more than cyphers one example is the role of macro played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role but is mostly left in the background the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium however
writer & director robert downey sr a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant garde comedy putney swope downey doesnt confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in hollywoods portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle as audacious and ambitious as putney swope strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoe string budget with a no name cast and humor that lacks hilarity everything about this movie reeks with improvisation putney swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture like most marx brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for downeys anecdotal gags most of which are terrible the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member putney swope arnold johnson since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him swope pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm truth and soul advertising swope decides to alter the face of american advertising he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys swopes clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo and grandstanding attracts a new line up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swopes militant employees swope exploits his african american staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a new wave of marketing genius incredibly swopes conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swopes advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security the high point of this black & white 85 minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color unfortunately downey doesnt know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome the funniest part of putney swope involves our eponymous protagonists dealings with us president mimeo in washington dc pepi hermine a marihuana toking midget with a kissinger like teutonic adviser larry wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the borman 6
probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex  what do people mean by hard core sex  the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and  big  john holmes  well anyway this is really poor film  i doubt if i`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film  the script is really poor and plotless  the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant  it truly is an absolutely awful film you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about  the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them  yes you read that right  a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower  trivia point many years ago a pirate copy of the thing  1982 version  was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts  this led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos  but having seen the whole of caligula i don`t know what it meant either
who really wants to see that disgusting violence disgusting sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next friday its basically just crap how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman emperor as an excuse for gore and t&a yeah yeah hey its realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us with it i dont care if it has been like this and there are a lot of scenes where i truly doubt it the point is why should anyone wanna see it problem is there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence theres nothing special about it just cruelty you can say cool as youd say in splatter slasher movie but horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement maybe characters you care about but here everything is dark dull and boring every character is mad the story of an emperor who cant deal with his power what in the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister i have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 1 2 hours but maybe you get turned on by seeing helen mirren being pregnant and dancing or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie or castration yeah right that was fun real birth scenes how hilarious humans animals who cares lets just treat them as toys i dont care what anyone says this is no movie this is just 2 1 2 hours of blood and sex degrading and disgusting go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence at least those movies dont pretend to be some artistic masterpiece and they are shorter 0 10 6 1+   6  0 4
as a semi film buff i had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago i had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the roman emperor caligula complete with hard core pornography what struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like peter otoole john geilgud malcolm mcdowell and hellen mirren in it a week ago i saw a documentary about caligula on the history channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me i foolishly rented the dvd and even more foolishly watched it within the first 30 minutes i was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an nc 17 even by todays standards was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail and a scene where a guy gets his d*** cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detailand this just scratches the surface the argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan rome and its excesses when in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation from beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable sadomasochism rape necrophelia it just never stopped there is no insight into caligula himself what might have propelled him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult this is not a historic film it is sleaze even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when i wasnt gagging i was just incredibly bored by the time it was over i was depressed didnt feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sex what were these great actors thinking when they got into this i did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into right at the opening credits it says penthouse magazine and bob gucionne presents and the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves apparently director tinto brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter gore vidal of all people even john geilgud and peter otoole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the cannes film festival for the amount of money the producers spent on this the movies quality is terrible everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and thats when youre lucky enough to view a scene thats actually in focus the sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful anyway i brought this movie on myself my advicedont watch this dont watch this dont watch thisas for myself tomorrow night i am going to watch something lighterlike dawn of the dead
210 minute version extremely hardcore or so i hear or the r rated version released into theaters both are terribly awful of course peter otoole and malcolm mcdowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film the latter of the two men reported this in an imdb interview and i can see why nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half hearted attempt at a plot not much of anything here other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes i liked what mcdowell himself said about the film it was like one moment id be staring admiring my mule or something and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it how true what an awful movie 1 5 stars
although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome caligula is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics like spartacus or gladiator that style of movie making was out of favour in the late seventies rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty at least the shortened 150 minute version does i have never seen the full 210 minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty  as one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of penthouse there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues caligulas sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister drusilla what is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes the obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though bob guccione gore vidal and tinto brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone it is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called brass and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called gore characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape  the emperor caligula and his predecessor tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the films concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate i do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in roman history both the fall of the roman empire and gladiator were set during the reign of commodus an emperor quite as cruel and licentious as caligula in neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of up pompeii emmanuelle and the texas chainsaw massacre and both those films are artistically far better than caligula the acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden teresa ann savoy as drusilla malcolm mcdowell makes a suitably insane caligula suitable that is in the context of this film the real caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill the great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished british actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production in the case of helen mirren the only dame of the british empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what peter otoole and john gielgud thought they were doing unlike some other famous stage actors such as laurence olivier and richard burton gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of nerva a decent and honourable senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill  guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence whether brass and vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question the film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship even seen as erotica it is second rate 4 10
i found the movie at my local video store and i was surprised to see it on dvd i had heard about the explicit sex scenes gruesome violence and the notorious debauchery i sat and watched and i began laughing the set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written the incestuous relationship between caligola malcolm mcdowell and his serenely beautiful sister drusilla theresa ann savoy a vulnerable beauty cant be taken seriouslyits not even shocking or repulsive peter otoole and john geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film the cinematography was a joke and i was even more amused when they used a quote from the bible the book of mark no less if you are looking for shock value this movie will disappoint you if you are looking for camp cult value you will be even more disappointed i know i was i have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back
as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate  i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly one caligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies  huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine   a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts  technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie 1 10 lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about 15 minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying  all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epic there are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beauty there are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offer there are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moral there are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples minds caligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group
incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path i know there are several versions of this and this is based on the 102 min one that i watched   but i cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck id heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all   and boring when there is and blood but beware   its the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camera work is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven   is it day or night are they in  or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression   and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much its tragic a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and fellini like turkey thats only good for a few gobble laughs and peter otoole who makes a most memorable tiberius oh yes which brings us to the big name actors id like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this there ive wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time   period 1 out of 10 from ozjeppe
im currently slogging through gibbons fall and decline of the roman empire  so ive had all things roman on my mind im not very far into it yet maybe two hundred plus pages but it is amazing just how many of these roman emperors were killed i believe ive read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only antonius trajan and hadrian havent been killed or at least suspected of having been killed i have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of rome not the least practitioner of these was caligula this brings me to reviewing this film im thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as i understand it from gibbons explanation of romeas well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period my point is i do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of its proponents i do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate the general ideas of the film seem accurate caligula is raised on an island exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad suspicious and strange emperor tiberius he grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards little boots this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless he is handed the empire after tiberius dies the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant and lead rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into caligula begins as a decent if hands off emperor but gets sick almost dies and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster his perversities with his sisters do begin here if not before he does have macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters the acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living god him seen talking to the statue of jupiter as an equal doomed him his violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of tiberius well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent which is not common through its entirety it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient rome the shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails it is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered raped tortured for no reason but fancy the depictions of the violence are possibly but not probably accurate murder certainly was the order of the day in imperial rome torture beforehand was rote but the directors visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists while the bystanders watch with nonchalance i just dont see it having gone down exactly like that the death machine the beheader is certainly something like youve never seen in movies and something once seen you shall probably never forget even as i you wish you could the wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same once youve seen this shame it is yours forever these things strike me the directors and that porn magnates fantasies they sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record the acting is pretty good i actually think mcdowell is the weakest link here mirren is always something to behold and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful the portrayals of nerva and tiberius are done very well by their respected actors the film could have done so much better story telling it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was for example it could have given opinion on how and why caligula went mad or shown that he was mad paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously it could have shown the weakness of claudius and the miracle it was he survived caligula it could have these and many other things but it stuck to its sad nightmares finally about the sex it is porn it shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people male on male female on female male on female it is passionless disgusting sex sex that if your point is to get off on it i seriously doubt you could both tiberius and caligula may have been sex addicts and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a greek time than a roman i dont think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange depraved reign of elgabalus and he was killed for it this film should probably never be watched if your curious about it  let it go it is something as i said earlier if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain its sick visions in your minds eye for years to come i dont think its an accurate historical picture in particular even if it is historical in whole
its a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen but when you see a noble actor like sir john gielgud surrounded by naked copulating couples thats just what youll want to do add to that peter otoole as syphilis ridden emperor tiberius and malcolm mcdowell sticking his finger up a male victims anus and you begin to appreciate that caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick outrageous films the film charts the life of notorious roman emperor caligula mcdowell a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters decapitations betrayals murders incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes although caligula was totally mad in real life and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not the film is still inexcusable filth the sex in the film isnt used as one aspect in a multi layered story   the sex is the story after a while all the nudity hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition the performances are totally undisciplined particularly mcdowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild eyed posturing otoole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves surely hes in it purely for the money rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the directors consent during post production but in truth there isnt a single minute in caligula that is dignified or well made it is doubtful that this amount of time talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again so in that sense caligula is a one of a kind experience on the other hand its so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is one of a kind is a blessing in disguise
starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles starving children and mutilated palestinians i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then oh my god actually have pay for what they have done i kept watching and many questions are raised were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did lots of questions asked and then dropped no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial nothing in short nothing new from what every swede has seen on tv a hundred times   just poor propaganda
i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends its reputation had preceded it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close proximity to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each others presence as it turned out the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content but it disappointed in every other way caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick it fails miserably in its ambition subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds the films obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real graphic sex but in setting this sex in the context of caligulas depraved reign it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of caligula in it sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination in the present day it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it the historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex they fail to entertain enlighten intrigue or interest the viewer in any way they only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium rarely has a film proved so boring the sex after the initial shock and astonishment fades only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence while many films more violent than caligula have been made few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence apparenly unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper depraved sexuality characterized caligulas emperorship the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells i understand why someone would want to see this film after all i myself succumbed to the same curiosity i simply hope that my review by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror this statement perfectly describes caligula you have been warned
its rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but caligula surely must hold this title im not sure what is more horrendous the violence the sexual perverseness the acting or the plot or severe lack thereof the two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous roman caesar caligula to to throne in 37ad and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power the acting is lifeless and dull   but thats just the tip of the iceberg obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible but dont be fooled these scenes dont ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film the camera work is shoddy dialog is laughable in fact youd have to congratulate malcolm mcdowell playing caligula for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines and then theres the violence if you are about to see the film be prepared some atrocities are committed in the film not just through the writing but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer this is only objective this movie achieved one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality necrophilia and castration just to name a few would be appealing to anyone when it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever youve been warned
some describe caligulia as the most controversial film of its era while this is debatable it is certainly one of the most embarrassing virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it author gore vidal actually sued with mixed results to have his name removed from the film and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence what they wanted of course was for it to go away for a while it looked like it might caligula was a major box office and critical flop producer guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all and although the film was released on vhs to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade but now caligulia is on dvd available in both edited r and original unrated versions and no doubt john gielgud is glad he didnt live to see it happen the only way to describe caligulia is to say it is something like deep throat meets david lynchs dune by way of fellini having an off day vidals script fell into the hands of penthouse publisher bob guccione who used vidals reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars  and then threw out most of vidals script and brought in soft porn director tinto brass then when guccione felt brass work wasnt explicit enough he and giancarlo lui photographed hardcore material on the sly viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination there is a tremendous amount of nudity and that remains in the edited version but the original comes complete with xxx scenes there is very explicit gay lesbian and straight sex kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dancing roman guards thrown in for good measure the film is also incredibly violent and bloody with rape torture and mutilation the order of the day in one particularly disturbing scene a man is slowly stabbed to death a woman urinates on his corpse and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs in a documentary that accompanies the dvd release guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan rome if so he missed the mark we know very little about caligula  and what little we know is questionable at best that aside orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of roman society where adultery was an offense punishable by death and certainly ancient rome never looked like the strange slightly oriental oddly space age sets and costumes offered by the designers on the plus side those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice the score is also very very good the most successful member of the cast is helen mirren who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the empress caesonia gielgud and otoole also escape in reasonably good form the same cannot be said for mcdowell but in justice to him he doesnt have much to work with the movie does possess a dark fascination but ultimately it is an oddity more interesting for its design and flat out weirdness than for content some of the bodies on display including mcdowells and mirrens are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography but then again some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism if youre up to it it is worth seeing once but once is likely to be enough gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
as i read the script on line i thought capote needed a trim having just seen it on ppv i can tell you it wasnt trimmed it was butchered like that poor family example in the script truman dubs shawn adorable one here he is mr shawn bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de flame capote and bash his circle are we to really believe they thought so little of nelle they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in joke they turn perry smith into this oh so sensitive victim even as hes shown dispatching the clutters its one thing to fudge the facts its another to drop the ball the executions were carried out between 1245 119 am april 14 truman is shown at the prison 22 hours later i was totally underwhelmed by the acting keener doesnt even try to sound like an alabama native the way cooper kept shouting alvin i was waiting for the chimpmunks to show up hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly but a pathetic suck up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time when hoffman whines about being tortured by the endless appeals i wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out
in this film were invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isnt likable to start with what was the point of making the film then to show that it would have been better not to have had in cold blood   a book i admire incidentally   in order to have kept our heros integrity intact hardly he behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book so his degradation is a matter of degree are we supposed to care enough about capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer perry smith are kindred spirits with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none mr capotes plight didnt touch me at all im afraid so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me but even if i could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect while keener and cooper are so warm and interesting that i was yearning for more of them dreary beyond belief
many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance i went from suspended disbelief to fidgety boredom to almost walking out there is no there there hoffman does go all out he is committed to the performance but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders   nell jack perry shawn the sheriff are all one dimensional yes the film shows the manipulative preening dishonest sides of capote it shows them so many times i started to wonder why    do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out and again and again it refers often to capotes genius but does not show it it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why but my goal is not to deconstruct the film i am sure others will have other interpretations for me this was a two hour movie that felt like five
this is one dreary inert self important bore when the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is botched philip seymour hoffman plays truman capote as a narcissistic tic ridden self indulgent cartoon voiced insect like caricature why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information the script focuses on capotes writing of in cold blood and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four the acclaimed writer of to kill a mockingbird harper lee catherine keener accompanies capote in his initial inquires into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic unfortunately lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of capote bemoaning his pained existence watching him is like watching dr smith from lost in space complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours the difference however is that smith was fun to watch while capote is not the films precious self importance kills it as does director bennett millers reluctance to add any kind of shading like the morose piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional coloring and no intimate drama if capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it though the supporting roles are well performed chris cooper is his usual stalwart self they serve such little dramatic purpose because ultimately its all about capote director bennett and screenwriter dan futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of capotes legend their product is stillborn oscar baitand is more evidence that one great genre pic has more truth in it than a dozen piles of oh so sincere crap like this
awful awful awful times a hundred still doesnt begin to describe how crappy biggest loser is picture this take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say humiliate them and let them work to lose weight all on prime time television am i the only one who thinks that this isnt something people with iqs in the 3 digit area want to watch everything drags on forever with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives does anyone care do they think we care do they care if we care probably not i think ill videotape myself doing crunches and sell it to some major television corporation if this passes for television then so can my workouts
i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the shows contestants are they are pathetic not because they are fat but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune for anyone to appear on national tv and blubber sniffle and whine about being fat entirely their own fault is nauseating what does this say about us as a nation does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and the consequences of them arent our responsibility  the biggest loser is an appropriate title but it has nothing to do with ones weight absolute trash
when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or cant sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weightmost americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i dont know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence
the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage a trois fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience its really rather messy though fellowes doesnt seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat edged rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves the dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché landmine though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score cant create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces theres also a very prosaic dare i say it british feel to the filming i didnt want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination wilkinson and watson support this meta essay with good performances and john warnabys ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow furrowing im disappointed not that its bad but that it could have been much better 3 10
four things intrigued me as to this film   firstly it stars carly pope of popular fame who is always a pleasure to watch secdonly it features brilliant new zealand actress rena owen thirdly it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission fourthly a friend recommended it to me however i was utterly disappointed the whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution popes acting is fine but owen is unfortunately under used the other actors and actresses are all okay but i am unfamiliar with them all aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie and pope and owen this film isnt very good so the moral of the story isdont watch it unless you really want to
david bryces comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970 it cost 22 million dollars that is simply irresponsible darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque the result is a hybrid of gigi zeppelin half a sixpence some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style daisies and boaters so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and mata hari dramatics the production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance julie looking befuddled hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up star released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hourbut lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s and made andrews look like poppins again which i believe was not edwards intention paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this and with another $20 million festering in catch 22 and $12 million in on a clear day and $25 million in paint your wagonthey had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double thank god paramount had their simple $1million yes one million dollar film love story and that $4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two yearsfor just $5m incredible
